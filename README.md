# dovetail

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dovetail is to help translate
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) lessons built using the
[Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/) and
translated (usually) with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/).

`dovetail` is in **early development** so much of the functionality is
likely to change.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dovetail like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("joelnitta/dovetail")
```

## Example

For an example of translating a lesson, see the [dovetail-demo
repo](https://github.com/joelnitta/dovetail-demo)
